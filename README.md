A simplified implementation of The Higher Lower game (https://www.higherlowergame.com/).

Game mechanics seem straightforward: it's all about who or what has more followers. The user must decide which person or item has more (higher) followers. When the user answers correctly, a new comparison option appears. The game continues until a wrong answer is given.

'python game.py' should be executted in CLI to run the game.
